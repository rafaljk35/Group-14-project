potentially be used in our project. It will be updated as I find new

Notes:
From what I can gather, "mbed" refers to the entire assembled development board, "LPC1768" is the microprocessor that makes it run.
The LPC1768 datasheet is very long and honestly hard to read, I'd recommend reading the link for it to see general information about it.
Supported I/O: Ethernet, USB Host/Device, 2xSPI, 2xI2C, 3xUART, CAN, 6xPWM, 6xADC, GPIO 
I'm unsure if we need to build the development board from scratch, so I've uploaded the full circuit schematic to build one, just in case.


ESP32 microcontroller

ESP32 development kits (scroll to the section labelled "ESP32 Series")
https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits

Notes:
Has integrated WiFi and Bluetooth. Is also the fastest MC I've checked so far (240MHz dual core)
Datasheet states it can be used for image recognition
Looks like it can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. Code seems similar to the Arduino. Link here :https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-code-structure
Supported I/O: 34 × programmable GPIOs (I think this means the total number of pins that can be used for I/O), 12-bit SAR ADC up to 18 channels,
, 2 × 8-bit DAC, 10 × touch sensors, 4 × SPI, 2 × I2S,2 × I2C,3 × UART,1 host (SD/eMMC/SDIO),1 slave (SDIO/SPI),
Ethernet MAC interface with dedicated DMA and IEEE 1588 support,TWAI , compatible with ISO 11898-1 (CAN Specification 2.0),RMT (TX/RX),
Motor PWM,LED PWM up to 16 channels,Hall sensor (IDK what a hall sensor is)
Personally I'm hesitant to use it because we have no experience using or coding on it. However, it is cheap and seems readily available.
If we do use it, I'd recommend checking if we can just buy the development kit instead of making it ourselves.
